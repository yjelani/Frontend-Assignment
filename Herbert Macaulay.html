    <H3>EARLY LIFE</H3>
    <p>Herbert Macaulay was born on 14 November 1864 on Broad Street, Lagos, to the family of Thomas Babington Macaulay and 
        Abigail Crowther. His parents were children of people captured from what is now Nigeria, resettled in Sierra Leone by 
        the British West Africa Squadron, and eventual returnees to present day Nigeria. Thomas Babington Macaulay was one of 
        the sons of Ojo Oriare while Abigail Crowther was the daughter of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, a descendant of King Abiodun.
        Thomas Babington Macaulay was the founder of the first secondary school in Nigeria, the CMS Grammar School, Lagos.</p>
        <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
        <P>Macaulay started primary school in 1869 and from 1877, he was educated at St Paul's Breadfruit School, Lagos and CMS Faji School, Lagos.
            From 1877 to October 1880, he attended CMS Grammar School, Lagos for his secondary education. 
            He was a student at the school when his father died in 1878.
            From 1891 to 1894 he studied civil engineering in Plymouth, England, and was also a pupil of G.D. Bellamy, a borough surveyor and water engineer in Plymouth.
            In 1893, he became a graduate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, London.
            Macaulay was also an accomplished musician who received a certificate in music from Trinity College, London and a certificate in violin playing from Music International College, London.

        <H3>CAREER</H3>
        <P> The first <strong>Nigerian</strong> to be trained in <i>England</i>. </P>
            <p>Upon his return to Lagos in September 1893, he resumed work with the colonial service as a surveyor of Crown Lands. He left the service as land inspector in September 1898 
            due to a growing distaste for the British rule of the Lagos Colony and the position of Yorubaland and the Niger Coast Protectorate as British protectorates. Other authors
             such as Patrick Dele-Cole have noted the abuse of office allegations (leveled by his British superiors) and pursuit of private gain controversy that clouded Macaulay's 
             resignation as surveyor of Crown Grants. Kristin Mann, citing British Colonial Government dispatches, notes that Macaulay behaved dishonestly, by using "his position as 
             Surveyor of Crown Lands to help friends acquire crown grants and persecute enemies by granting their land to others". She further writes that Macaulay "obtained crown grants 
            under false names and then sold them at a profit". In October 1898, he obtained a licence to practise as a surveyor. As a surveyor, his plans and valuations included 
            E. J. Alex Taylor's house on Victoria Street, Henry Carr's residence in Tinubu, Akinola Maja's house and Doherty Villa in Campos Square.</P>
            <p>He was founder of 4 <sup>2</sup> = 16</p>
<p>He was the first <u>mathematician</u> to use LOG<sub>2</sub>5 in the world. </p>
